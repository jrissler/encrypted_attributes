    # Encrypts the given attribute.
    # 
    # Configuration options:
    # * <tt>:mode</tt> - The mode of encryption to use.  Default is <tt>:sha</tt>.
    #   See EncryptedStrings for other possible modes.
    # * <tt>:to</tt> - The attribute to write the encrypted value to. Default
    #   is the same attribute being encrypted.
    # * <tt>:before</tt> - The callback to invoke every time *before* the
    #   attribute is encrypted
    # * <tt>:after</tt> - The callback to invoke every time *after* the
    #   attribute is encrypted
    # * <tt>:on</tt> - The ActiveRecord callback to use when triggering the
    #   encryption.  By default, this will encrypt on <tt>before_validation</tt>.
    #   See ActiveRecord::Callbacks for a list of possible callbacks.
    # * <tt>:if</tt> - Specifies a method, proc or string to call to determine
    #   if the encryption should occur. The method, proc or string should return
    #   or evaluate to a true or false value.
    # * <tt>:unless</tt> - Specifies a method, proc or string to call to
    #   determine if the encryption should not occur. The method, proc or string
    #   should return or evaluate to a true or false value. 
    # 
    # For additional configuration options used during the actual encryption,
    # see the individual cipher class for the specified mode.
    # 
    # == Encryption timeline
    # 
    # By default, attributes are encrypted immediately before a record is
    # validated.  This means that you can still validate the presence of the
    # encrypted attribute, but other things like password length cannot be
    # validated without either (a) decrypting the value first or (b) using a
    # different encryption target.  For example,
    # 
    #   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     encrypts :password, :to => :crypted_password
    #     
    #     validates_presence_of :password, :crypted_password
    #     validates_length_of :password, :maximum => 16
    #   end
    # 
    # In the above example, the actual encrypted password will be stored in
    # the +crypted_password+ attribute.  This means that validations can
    # still run against the model for the original password value.
    # 
    #   user = User.new(:password => 'secret')
    #   user.password             # => "secret"
    #   user.crypted_password     # => nil
    #   user.valid?               # => true
    #   user.crypted_password     # => "8152bc582f58c854f580cb101d3182813dec4afe"
    #   
    #   user = User.new(:password => 'longer_than_the_maximum_allowed')
    #   user.valid?               # => false
    #   user.crypted_password     # => "e80a709f25798f87d9ca8005a7f64a645964d7c2"
    #   user.errors[:password]    # => "is too long (maximum is 16 characters)"
    # 
    # == Encryption mode examples
    # 
    # SHA encryption:
    # 
    #   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     encrypts :password
    #     # encrypts :password, :salt => 'secret'
    #   end
    # 
    # Symmetric encryption:
    # 
    #   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     encrypts :password, :mode => :symmetric
    #     # encrypts :password, :mode => :symmetric, :key => 'custom'
    #   end
    # 
    # Asymmetric encryption:
    # 
    #   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     encrypts :password, :mode => :asymmetric
    #     # encrypts :password, :mode => :asymmetric, :public_key_file => '/keys/public', :private_key_file => '/keys/private'
    #   end
    # 
    # == Dynamic configuration
    # 
    # For better security, the encryption options (such as the salt value)
    # can be based on values in each individual record.  In order to
    # dynamically configure the encryption options so that individual records
    # can be referenced, an optional block can be specified.
    # 
    # For example,
    # 
    #   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     encrypts :password, :mode => :sha, :before => :create_salt do |user|
    #       {:salt => user.salt}
    #     end
    #     
    #     private
    #       def create_salt
    #         self.salt = "#{login}-#{Time.now}"
    #       end
    #   end
    # 
    # In the above example, the SHA encryption's <tt>salt</tt> is configured
    # dynamically based on the user's login and the time at which it was
    # encrypted.  This helps improve the security of the user's password.
